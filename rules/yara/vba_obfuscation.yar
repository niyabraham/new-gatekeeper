/*
    vba_obfuscation.yar
    Detects obfuscation techniques used to evade static analysis in VBA macros.
    These rules complement the MacroDeobfuscator — they flag obfuscation as a
    risk signal even before deobfuscation reconstructs the hidden strings.

    Note on Chr() rules: these fire on the RAW corpus before deobfuscation.
    The deobfuscator then collapses them. A heavy Chr() count is itself
    a strong malice indicator regardless of what the decoded string says.
