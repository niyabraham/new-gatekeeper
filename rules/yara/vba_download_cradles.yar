    vba_download_cradles.yar
    Detects HTTP/FTP download cradles used to fetch second-stage payloads,
    hardcoded URLs/IPs, and combined download-and-execute patterns (dropper).

    This is one of the highest-value rule files — download cradles are
    present in the majority of real-world macro-based malware including
    Emotet, Trickbot, Dridex, and Qakbot campaigns.
