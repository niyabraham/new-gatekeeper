/*
    vba_process_injection.yar
    Detects Windows API calls associated with process injection and
    memory manipulation from VBA macros. These techniques are used by
    sophisticated malware to inject shellcode or DLLs into other processes.

    VBA accesses these APIs via Declare Function / Declare Sub statements
    that import from system DLLs (kernel32.dll, ntdll.dll, etc.).
    The presence of these declarations is itself the detection signal —
    legitimate Office documents have no reason to call these APIs.

    MITRE ATT&CK: T1055 (Process Injection)
                  T1055.001 (Dynamic-link Library Injection)
                  T1055.003 (Thread Execution Hijacking)
